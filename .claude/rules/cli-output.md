# CLI output rules

### Critical Rule 35 — All terminal output goes through the shared `console` in `tokenjam/utils/formatting.py`

It sets `highlight=False` — never construct a bare `rich.Console()`, and never write a raw colour name
in markup. Rich's automatic highlighter is **on by default** and repaints *prose* by pattern
regardless of the markup you wrote (numbers, paths, a bare `/` in a sentence, brackets, quoted
strings, ellipses). It corrupts copy rather than merely adding noise: `Max 20x plan` renders as
`Max 2` plus a cyan `0x`, because the highlighter matches `0x` as a hex literal. A fresh `Console()`
anywhere re-imports the whole problem for that surface.

**Deliberate colour goes through the named roles in `tokenjam/utils/theme.py`** (`accent`, `brand`,
`url`, `label`, `heading`, `muted`, `ok`, `warn`, `error`), so the palette is auditable and changeable
in one file. The discipline they encode, modelled on Claude Code's own CLI: prose is plain;
**`accent` means exactly one thing — a string the user can type or click** (command, path, config
key, URL), never decoration or emphasis; structure is weight (`label`/`heading`), not colour;
**success is a `✓` plus bold, never green**, because a colour spent on the least surprising outcome
stops meaning anything; past the accent, colour is reserved for genuine state — `warn` for a blocker
the user must act on *now*, `error` for a real failure. Two traps: **`[bold]` nested inside `[dim]`
renders bold-dim**, neither emphasis nor recession; and a **single coloured row inside an otherwise
plain field list reads as a failure**, so an informational row in a summary block stays plain even
when it reports a degraded outcome. `tests/unit/test_cli_palette.py` pins all of this, including that
`cmd_onboard.py` contains no raw `[green]`/`[yellow]`/`[red]`. When judging a change here, **render it
and inventory the SGR codes** (`FORCE_COLOR=1 … | cat -v`, then group the distinct `\e[...m`
sequences); each emitted code should have a stateable job.

## `tokenjam/cli/`

`main.py` is the root Click group with global options (`--config`, `--json`, `--no-color`, `--db`,
`--agent`, `-v`) and registers all subcommands. `tj --help` lists them; the non-obvious ones are
below. All commands support `--json`; commands that query alerts exit 1 if active (unacknowledged,
unsuppressed) alerts exist. Terminal-output discipline is Critical Rule 35, above.

### Commands

- **The zero-install / zero-config first run** (`cmd_quickstart.py`) has **no public/typeable command name** — `quickstart` is not a registered subcommand. It opens a **transient `InMemoryBackend`** (nothing written to `~/.tj`, no config read/written, no daemon started or contacted) and backfills `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl` into it via `ingest_claude_code`. **The human screen is deliberately three beats and nothing else: what tj read, one avoidable-dollars sentence, and the pointer to `npx tokenjam onboard`.** No quota composition, no statusline preview, no per-analyzer titles/evidence/fixes, no boxes — a founder decision recorded in the module docstring; adding a panel reverses it. The avoidable-dollars sentence is the SINGLE LARGEST `past_overspend_usd` cost proposal over the ingested window, built through the same `build_report` / `cost_proposals_from_report` path `tj status`'s teaser and the Review inbox use, so persona gating stays in `build_report` (quickstart hands it an in-memory `TjConfig(version="1")` and still reads/writes no config). `relearn` is the one analyzer dropped from `COST_ANALYZERS` there: it leaves `past_overspend_*` at `None`, so it can never win the selection, while dominating the runtime of the full set. Quota composition (`core/context_diagnostic.py`) and `core/session_timeline.py` survive **only** as fields of the `--json` payload, which returns before the human path's analyzer pass runs. Output leads with ccusage-parity framing ("reads the same files ccusage does"). The **only** invocation path is bare `npx tokenjam` (the `npm-wrapper/` package — the bare `tj` name is squatted on npm): the wrapper sets `TJ_NPX_ZERO_INSTALL_REPORT=1` when invoking `tj` with no args, and `main.py`'s no-subcommand branch reads that env var and invokes `cmd_quickstart` via `ctx.invoke`. `tj onboard` remains the opt-in "go deeper" (daemon/MCP/live) path. **Bare LOCAL `tj` (no subcommand, no env var) prints the branded home screen** (`cli/home.py` `print_home()`) — banner + next-best-action, reading only config presence, never the DB; `--help`/`--version` are eager and still short-circuit.
- **`tj demo [scenario]`** (`cmd_demo.py`) — runs Agent Incident Library scenarios (zero-config, no API keys). `tj demo` lists all; `tj demo retry-loop` runs one.
- **`tj doctor`** (`cmd_doctor.py`) — health checks (config, DB, secrets, webhooks, drift readiness, schema-vs-capture consistency). Exit 0 = ok, 1 = warnings, 2 = errors. `--repair` reconciles schema gaps and cleans a database an older build doubled.
- **`tj optimize`** (`cmd_optimize.py`) — registry-driven. **Analyzers are positional args** (not `--finding <name>`): `tj optimize downsize cache trim` runs three; bare `tj optimize` runs all. The registered names are `ANALYZER_REGISTRY` / `ANALYZER_ORDER` in `core/optimize/runner.py` — derive the list from there, never from an enumeration kept in a doc. Flags: `--since 30d`, `--budget <provider>`, `--budget-usd <amount>`, `--compare <period>` (window-cost diff vs prior period; accepts `previous` / `last-week` / `last-month` / `last-7d` / `last-30d` / `YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD`), `--export-config <target>` (writes a routing snippet, target `claude-code`, under `~/.config/tokenjam/exports/`; no `--apply` flag by design). Plan-tier-aware rendering via `core/framing`: subscription users see "implied API value" framing and token-share savings (never dollar "spend"), local users token-only framing, unknown-plan users dollar figures suppressed with a `tj onboard --reconfigure` hint. Works alongside a running `tj serve` via the `/api/v1/optimize` HTTP fallback when the daemon holds the DuckDB write lock.
- **`tj tokenmaxx`** (`cmd_tokenmaxx.py`) — shareable **quota/efficiency card**: an efficiency brag, never a spend brag. Leads with the context-COMPOSITION headline from `compute_context_diagnostic` (`core/context_diagnostic.py`): what share of quota went to *overhead* (re-reading history / CLAUDE.md / tool output, i.e. `diag.reread_share`) vs *real work* (uncached input + output). Classifies into named efficiency tiers keyed on the overhead share — the tier names and their cutoffs are the `_TIERS` ladder in `cmd_tokenmaxx.py`, the only place either lives; lower overhead = leaner = a better tier. **Quota-native:** the headline renders as a token-share / "% of cycle tokens" via `core/framing` (the same `_quota_share` path `cmd_context` uses); dollars are demoted to a secondary "Implied API value" line shown ONLY for `api` plans and suppressed for subscription / local / unknown. Needs a **direct DuckDB connection** (reads context composition; can't run against a live `tj serve` — same as `tj context` / `tj quota-audit`). `--weekly` is a 7-day "Quota Wrapped" recap preset. Output is a bordered Panel designed for screenshotting; the action line points at `tj context` (reclaim overhead) or `tj optimize`. Honesty discipline (Critical Rule 14): the efficiency number is a measured token share, never a guaranteed saving.
- **`tj cost`** (`cmd_cost.py`) — cost breakdown by `--group-by agent|model|day|tool`. Same `--compare <period>` flag as `tj optimize` for window-over-window diffs (▲/▼ indicators, per-agent and per-model top-shifts, dollar + token deltas).
- **`tj backfill <source>`** (`cmd_backfill.py`) — ingest historical telemetry. Subcommands: `claude-code` (`~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl`, auto-invoked at the end of `tj onboard --claude-code`), `codex` (`~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`; provider/agent always `openai`/`codex_exec`), `langfuse` and `helicone` (live API or JSON dump), `otlp` (raw OTLP JSON via URL or file, reusing the live `POST /api/v1/spans` parser). All idempotent via deterministic span IDs; adapter internals live in `core/ingest_adapters/`. **See Critical Rule 33 before changing how a windowed (`--since`) pass behaves.**
- **`tj onboard`** (`cmd_onboard.py`) — `--claude-code` and `--codex` trigger integration-specific flows, writing to the **global** config. All paths, including plain `tj onboard`, prompt for plan tier (api / pro / max_5x / max_20x for Anthropic; api / plus / team / enterprise for OpenAI) and write it to `[budget.<provider>] plan = "..."`; `--plan <tier>` sets it non-interactively. The plain path is Claude-first: its prompt offers the Anthropic tiers, and an OpenAI-only `--plan` is routed to `[budget.openai]`. `--reconfigure` re-prompts against an existing config. It does NOT auto-write a cycle ceiling: subscription users get only the `plan` field, API users are explicitly asked. Managed-dotfile-block discipline is Critical Rule 21.
- **`tj report`** (`cmd_report.py`) — standalone HTML visualizations of analyzer findings. `--trim [<agent_id>]` renders the Trim analyzer's per-token significance (was `--bloat` pre-0.3.1, renamed with the analyzer's registry string); `--reuse [<agent_id>]` renders the Reuse analyzer's per-cluster planning skeleton (HTML + Markdown sidecars). Writes to `~/.cache/tokenjam/reports/` (override via `TOKENJAM_REPORT_DIR`) and opens in the default browser. `--reuse` works while the daemon holds the DB lock: like `tj optimize` it dispatches to `ApiBackend.fetch_reuse_clusters` (`GET /api/v1/reuse/clusters`) and renders from the HTTP payload (`write_reuse_report(..., planning_texts=...)`) instead of a direct DB connection (#154). `--trim` remains DB-direct only.
- **`tj policy list`** (`cmd_policy.py`) — read-only preview of the unified policy surface, consolidating `[alerts]`, `[alerts.channels]`, `[defaults.budget]`, `[budget.<provider>]`, per-agent `budget`/`drift`/`sensitive_actions`/`output_schema`, and `[capture]` into one table, each row carrying its source TOML section. Supports `--json`; `list` and `decisions` are the only subcommands; `policy` is in `no_db_commands`. Source-section strings (`[budget.anthropic]`, `[[alerts.channels]]`) must pass through `rich.markup.escape()` before rendering, or Rich consumes them as style tags.
- **`tj summarize`** (`cmd_summarize.py`) — structure-aware prompt summarization (advisory). `list` scans read-only for prompt files worth summarizing (catalog-default; any scope-widening flag opens it to `*.md`) and estimates the per-call token saving. `prep`/`check` are the mechanism: `prep` wraps a prompt's structure behind id'd `<tj-keep>` markers and emits it for rewriting (CLI manual/copy, or the MCP `summarize_prep`/`summarize_check` tools for in-session rewrites); `check` re-reads and hash-guards the file, restores every block verbatim by id, and stages the result **only if structure survives** (a hard gate). No scratch state — the file on disk is the source of truth; `summarize` is in `no_db_commands` (config-only). `apply` writes a staged rewrite back: default **dry-run** printing the unified diff, `--go` writes, guarded by an owner + content-hash + symlink check and a gzip backup; `undo` restores from that backup, refusing on drift. `prep --via claude-p` (your local `claude -p`, no key) or `prep --via api` (Anthropic with your `TJ_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` plus the required `[summarize] api_model`, reporting a "pays for itself" amortization) runs the rewrite in one shot — both still pass the `check` gate before staging.
- **`tj rules`** (`cmd_rules.py`, `core/rulewrite/`) — the permanent CLAUDE.md rules the analyzers propose, and WHERE each one goes. `list`/`show` read the proposal cache the optimize pass already wrote (`rules` is in `no_db_commands` — config only, no analyzer sweep, works while `tj serve` holds the DuckDB lock); `stage` renders one diff PER DESTINATION; `check` re-verifies each against the file as it stands now; `apply` writes (default **dry-run**, `--go` writes, gzip backup first); `undo` reverts per destination; `applied` lists what can still be undone. The safety model is `core/summarize/apply`'s, reused rather than reimplemented (owner + content-hash + symlink guards, atomic write, refuse-on-drift undo); the block rendering is `relearn_apply.render_note_content`'s, so a re-apply replaces its own marked block instead of duplicating it and the Revert path can still find it. **Partial outcomes are first-class:** three project files written and a fourth skipped for drift is the reported result, never rounded up to "applied". Mirrored at `GET/POST /api/v1/rules/*` and on the Lens **Optimize ▸ Rules** screen (`#/optimize/rules`), which exists because a Review-inbox card can express one write, not "this rule, into these 4 of your 11 projects, here is each diff, apply selectively".
- **`tj pricing list`** (`cmd_pricing.py`) — read-only inspection of the resolved pricing table: one row per `(provider, model)` with `input` / `output` / `cache_read` / `cache_write` rates and a `source` column (`override` / `packaged`). Supports `--json` and `--model <substring>` (case-insensitive). `pricing` is in `no_db_commands` (config-only). The CLI reads the public `core/pricing.load_pricing_sources()` rather than re-deriving precedence; a listed row is always `packaged` or `override`, since the `DEFAULT_INPUT_PER_MTOK` / `DEFAULT_OUTPUT_PER_MTOK` fallback in `core/pricing.py` applies only to models absent from the table, which never appear here.

### `no_db_commands`

Commands that don't open the DB at startup — read the set in `main.py` rather than trusting an
enumeration here. New commands that read only from config (or do their own DB connection later)
should be added to this set so they work when `tj serve` holds the write lock. Tests for these
commands can patch `open_db` with `side_effect=AssertionError(...)` to verify they never touch the DB.

### CLI data access: direct DuckDB vs the daemon (`data_access.py`)

**DuckDB permits one writer OR many readers across processes — there is no concurrent read-only escape hatch.** Verified empirically (DuckDB 1.5.1): while one process holds a read-write connection (i.e. `tj serve`), a second process calling `duckdb.connect(path, read_only=True)` **fails** with `IOException: Could not set lock on file … Conflicting lock is held`. A CLI command therefore can NOT sidestep the daemon's write-lock by opening the DB read-only. **Consequence:** any command needing computed data from the DB while the daemon runs must route the compute through the daemon, which owns the connection.

That routing lives behind **one seam, not per-command duck-typing**: `resolve_data_access(ctx)` returns a `DataAccess` — `DirectDataAccess` (a direct `DuckDBBackend.conn`, daemon down) or `ServeDataAccess` (routed through `tj serve` via `ApiBackend`, daemon up). Commands ask the seam for the built dataclass (e.g. `data.context_diagnostic(...)`, `data.quota_audit(...)`) and **never branch on `hasattr(db, "conn")` / `isinstance(db, ApiBackend)`** to pick a path — the seam owns that choice. It replaced ad-hoc `hasattr`-sniffing fallbacks that drifted silently and left `tj tokenmaxx` / `tj quota-audit` with no daemon-up path at all.

**Adding a new command that needs DB-computed data:** use the seam. If it needs a compute the read-only shim can't serve (raw `attributes`, per-session aggregates), add a `GET /api/v1/<x>` route mirroring `api/routes/context.py` / `api/routes/quota_audit.py` (reads `request.app.state.db/config`, computes server-side, returns `<x>_to_dict(...)` + the `framing` block), a matching `ApiBackend.fetch_<x>` plus a `<x>_to_dict`/`<x>_from_dict` **round-trip pair** (so the serve path can't silently drop a rendered field), and a **parity assertion** in `tests/integration/test_data_access_parity.py` (Direct vs Serve must produce byte-identical output over the same DB — the silent-drift guard). `fetch_*` methods live *outside* the `StorageBackend` protocol, so they are NOT covered by `test_storage_backend_parity.py`; the data-access parity test is their guard.

### Testing the CLI

Tests use `click.testing.CliRunner` with `unittest.mock.patch` on `tokenjam.cli.main.load_config`
and `tokenjam.cli.main.open_db` to inject an `InMemoryBackend` and test config. See
`tests/integration/test_cli.py`. Note: `cmd_doctor` opens its own DuckDB connection via
`config.storage.path` to verify writability — in tests you must set this to a real temp path (e.g.
`tmp_path / "test.duckdb"`).

**Test factories:** `tests/factories.py` provides `make_llm_span(billing_account="anthropic", ...)`
and `make_session(plan_tier="api", ...)` with safe defaults that preserve existing test behavior.
Tests exercising subscription / local / unknown plan-tier rendering paths should pass the field
explicitly. (Critical Rule 8 — never construct a `NormalizedSpan` directly in a test.)

### Daemon (launchd / systemd)

`is_serve_process()` fails closed only when process identity is unavailable
(`ps` is missing, inaccessible, or has an invalid path). Resource exhaustion
while spawning `ps` must propagate; treating `EAGAIN` or `ENOMEM` as a negative
identity check can make `tj upgrade` silently leave a live daemon on the old
version.

`tj onboard` (and `tj onboard --claude-code` / `--codex`) installs a background daemon that runs `tj serve` on login:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tokenjam.serve.plist` — loaded via `launchctl load`. Logs at `/tmp/tj-serve.{out,err}`.
- **Linux**: `~/.config/systemd/user/tokenjam.service` — enabled via `systemctl --user enable --now tokenjam`.
- **Other**: skipped with a notice; user runs `tj serve` manually.

Reinstall behavior: `--claude-code` and `--codex` onboard check `_daemon_already_running()` (launchctl list / systemctl is-active) and skip reinstall when the daemon is up unless `--force` is passed, avoiding spurious "Background Items Added" prompts on macOS during second-project onboards. The launchd path always uses `launchctl unload -w` then `launchctl load -w` — `-w` clears any Disabled=true entry from the launchd database (`tj stop` writes Disabled=true via `launchctl unload -w`), without which a subsequent plain `launchctl load` is a silent no-op. Use `tj stop` to halt the daemon, `tj uninstall` to remove unit files. `tj stop` also sweeps orphan foreground `tj serve` processes (e.g. from a manual `tj serve &`) so it reliably frees port 7391.

Before every DB write, onboard calls `_stop_serve_for_db_write()` (`cmd_onboard.py`), which stops the daemon via `stop_tj_serve()` (`cmd_stop.py`) and feeds the result into `stopped_for_db`; `_finish_onboard_serve()` then forces a restart (`need_restart = secret_rotated or plan_changed or stopped_for_db`), bypassing the already-running skip. For that skip to ever fire, `stop_tj_serve()` must report "stopped" ONLY when something was genuinely loaded/active — it checks `launchctl list <label>` (or `systemctl --user is-active`) before unloading/disabling, since `launchctl unload -w` and `systemctl disable --now` both return 0 even against a plist/unit that was never loaded. Without that check `stopped_for_db` is true on effectively every onboard run, and the daemon reinstalls/restarts every time with nothing changed.

`tj serve` writes its resolved config path to `~/.local/share/tj/server.state` at startup. This is informational: onboarding flows always write to the global config, so server.state is not used for secret-sync.

**Ephemeral-cache guard on the daemon unit itself (`_daemon_program_args`):** `npx tokenjam onboard` → `uvx --from tokenjam tj onboard` may still be running from a throwaway `uvx`/`pipx run` cache when it reaches daemon install — `_maybe_guard_ephemeral_runner()` (`cmd_onboard.py`) offers a persistent install at the top of onboard but doesn't force one (declined, or non-interactive). `_resolve_tj_binary()`'s fallback would then resolve to a path like `~/.cache/uv/archive-v0/<hash>/bin/tj`, which routine `uv cache prune`/`uv cache clean` deletes outright — silently killing the daemon on next load and freezing it on whatever version was resolved at onboard time. `_daemon_program_args()` detects that (`_is_ephemeral_path`) and points ProgramArguments/ExecStart at the stable `uvx`/`pipx` shim instead (`uvx --from tokenjam tj --config ... serve`), so launchd/systemd re-resolves `tj` on every start. If no durable entrypoint exists at all, it warns and skips the install rather than writing a cache path.

### Codex CLI integration

`tj onboard --codex` writes an `[otel]` block to `~/.codex/config.toml` (out-of-band telemetry only). It does **not** register the tj MCP for Codex — Codex has no statusline surface, so tj stays fully out-of-band via OTel + the `tj` CLI, and a re-onboard strips any legacy `[mcp_servers.tj]` block a previous version wrote. Notes:
- Codex hardcodes `service.name=codex_exec` in its binary and silently ignores `[otel.resource]`, so onboarding does **not** write that block — all Codex traces land under the `codex_exec` agent ID regardless of project. Onboarding is one-time global, not per-project.
- Codex emits OTLP **logs** (not spans) to `/v1/logs`; the conversion lives in `api/routes/logs.py` (see `.claude/rules/api.md`).
- Re-running `tj onboard --codex` is a no-op only when `[otel]` is already present in `~/.codex/config.toml` — the check is `[otel]`-only. Re-onboarding either Codex or Claude Code cross-syncs the ingest secret into the other's config when that one is already configured.
