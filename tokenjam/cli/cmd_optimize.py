# Plan-tier framing helpers (PLAN_LABEL_AND_FEE, pricing_mode_for,
# dominant_plan, config_declared_plan, plan_tier_mix) live in
# tokenjam.core.framing — the single source shared with cmd_tokenmaxx and the
# REST API. See issue #110. agent_persona_mix / dominant_persona (also
# framing.py) classify the window's dominant user (Claude Code subscriber vs
# SDK/API developer) so the downsize finding's call-to-action matches the
# levers that persona actually has — see #97. Framing / render_savings are
# the plan-tier-aware dollar-vs-token-share rendering rule itself; _render_resend
# is the one renderer in this file that feeds its recoverable figure through
# it instead of hand-branching on pricing_mode, so it can't silently drift
# from the rule cost_proposal_verbs.py already applies to the same figures.

# `placement` (batch-placement candidates) is a check that rides along inside
# `downsize`'s registry entry rather than being its own registered analyzer
# (see analyzers/batch_placement.py's module docstring and model_downgrade.py
# `run()`) — there is deliberately only one execution path for it. Without an
# alias here it had no typeable name at all: Click's Choice() only accepted
# ANALYZER_REGISTRY keys, so `tj optimize placement` was rejected before
# reaching the analyzer layer even though the finding already had a renderer
# and reached --json and the web tab (anti-pattern #24 — a surface reachable
# only as a side effect of another command isn't reachable at all). Typing
# it now runs `downsize` under the hood (never a second, standalone pass) and
# the rendered report shows the placement card without also surfacing the
# downsize card the user didn't ask for — see `_rank_findings`.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Scoreboard — the default `tj optimize` view
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `_render_report` above prints every finding card in full: candidate lists,
# verbatim caveats, methodology paragraphs. That is the right screen once you
# have chosen an area to work on, and the wrong one as an opening screen —
# several pages of justified prose in which the headline numbers, the
# per-area findings and the next command all sit at equal weight.
#
# So the card path is now reached deliberately rather than by default:
#
#   tj optimize            → the scoreboard below (never calls a card renderer)
#   tj optimize <area>     → that one card, in full, renderer untouched
#   tj optimize -v         → byte-for-byte what `tj optimize` printed before
#
# The one-line summaries live HERE, in the CLI layer, rather than as a new
# `summary` field on every analyzer's finding dataclass: they are a
# presentation concern of this one screen, and the analyzers must stay the
# single source of the prose that has to render verbatim.
#
# Honesty rails, which are the whole reason this is a summary and not a
# rewrite (Critical Rule 14 in tokenjam/CLAUDE.md, root anti-pattern 22):
#
#   * A `caveat` / `estimate_basis` / `coverage_note` is NEVER paraphrased
#     into a summary line. The scoreboard carries a pointer at the card that
#     prints them verbatim, and nothing else.
#   * A finding with no priced figure shows `—` in RECOVERABLE. Never `0`,
#     never blank: zero reads as "no waste", which is the opposite claim.
#   * An analyzer that ran and found nothing gets no row, and the
#     `N analyzers · M findings` header line carries the did-it-run signal so
#     silence is still not ambiguous.

    These fields were rewritten from single 40-90 word run-on paragraphs into
    short sentences grouped into paragraphs separated by a literal blank line

    soft-wrapped continuation of a long sentence and every paragraph after a
    blank line, starting back at column 0 and visually detaching it from the
    marker it belongs to.

    Built on a borderless two-column `Table.grid` (elsewhere in this file,
    `_render_scoreboard`'s `priced_rows` note reaches for `Padding` to solve
    the same class of problem for an unmarked block): the marker column is

    every line of the prose column — wrapped or blank-line-broken alike —
    under that same column start (root anti-pattern 30: pin the indent to
    every line the renderer produces, not just the first one it happened to
    be written for).

    `marker` is one-time leading markup (e.g. `"[yellow]![/yellow]"` for a
    caveat, `""` for a plain dim line) rendered once at `indent` spaces;
    continuation paragraphs align under the TEXT, not under the marker.
    `style` wraps the prose itself (`"italic"`, `"dim"`). `escape` must match
    each call site's PRE-EXISTING `_rich_escape` usage — several of these

    - A1 uncached agents: caching never attempted at all (zero cache reads
      AND zero cache writes on every call) despite a prefix large enough to
      matter.
    - A2 cache thrash: caching attempted regularly, but more was spent
      writing the prefix than was ever recovered reading it back. The card
      branches on cause — "ttl" (calls land more than five minutes apart, so
      the default 5-minute write keeps expiring before reuse) versus
      "instability" (calls land close together, so a TTL expiry doesn't
      explain it — the prefix itself is likely changing between calls).
    - A3 lookback miss: recurring cache misses that directly follow a long,
      tool-heavy turn — the shape of Anthropic's 20-block breakpoint
      lookback limit. Weakest-confidence of the three; an agent only lands
      here when A1/A2 don't already explain its waste.

    Classification is mutually exclusive per agent (uncached beats thrash
    beats lookback — see `_compute_root_cause_candidates`). Unlike the ratio

    proposals, gated by the same `persona` rule those proposals apply (see
