    doctor, statusline or the banner ever mentioned optimize existed.

    READS THE STORE, NEVER RUNS AN ANALYZER. This used to call `build_report`
    inline on every plain `tj status`, which dispatched the whole cost
    analyzer set (including the deliberately unbounded `relearn` scan) over
    the entire corpus and cost about a minute of CPU before the command
    returned. That is the identical failure `core/optimize/report_store.py`
    was written to end on the HTTP side ("no request path runs an analyzer");
    a CLI command that a user types to read a status table is the same kind of
    path. Analyzer runs happen at daemon boot, on the daemon's schedule, on a
    user Rescan, or when the user explicitly types `tj optimize` — and they
    all land in the store this reads.

    Reuses the same recoverable-savings contract every analyzer already
    carries (`past_overspend_usd`) rather than inventing a new figure, scoped
    to `COST_ANALYZERS` — the analyzers that actually feed the cost/apply rail
    (`cost_proposals.py`). The store holds every analyzer's finding, so the
    scoping is applied here on the read rather than by restricting the scan.

    Reports the LARGEST single analyzer's estimate rather than a sum across
    analyzers — mirroring `largest_recoverable_usd` in `api/routes/cost.py`.
    The analyzers price OVERLAPPING angles on the same spans (a cache fix and
    a downsize swap can both price the same call's waste), so summing them
    would double-count and print an inflated, non-additive headline; the
    single largest entry is honest standalone because it isn't a sum of
    anything (see `_recoverable_overlap_note` in `api/routes/cost.py` for the
    full rationale).

    A COLD store renders `_COLD_TEASER`: a command to run, never a number and
    never a zero. `$0.00 recoverable` off a scan that never ran reads as "you
    have no waste", which is a reassurance the data does not support (root
    anti-pattern 22). Otherwise silent (returns None) whenever the figure
    wouldn't mean anything: no config, or a sub-$1 figure. Dollars are shown
