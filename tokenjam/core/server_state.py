"""The `tj serve` PID file: `~/.local/share/tj/server.state`.

Written by `tj serve` (see `cmd_serve.py`) after uvicorn binds the port, so
other subcommands can find the daemon's config regardless of CWD. `tj stop`
(and, through it, `tj reset` / `tj uninstall`) reads it to locate the daemon
belonging to THIS install -- instead of a bare `pgrep -f`, which matches
every `tj serve` process on the machine, including ones started by a
different install/worktree with a different $HOME.

`Path.home()` is what actually scopes this: it resolves through the
invoking process's $HOME, so two installs with different $HOME never see
each other's state file, and never see each other's daemon.

    the module form (`tokenjam.serve` appears anywhere, e.g. `python -m
