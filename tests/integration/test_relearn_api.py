"""Security-guard tests for the self-improve loop's relearn write endpoints
(api/routes/relearn.py) — the PR-reviewer must-fix items:

  1. Mutating endpoints (apply/enable/disable/revert/refresh) require the
     always-on local write token, independent of ``api.auth.enabled``.
  2. ``/apply`` refuses a ``target_path`` outside the user's home directory
     (defense-in-depth allowlist) and — for a CLAUDE.md rule — a target that isn't an
     allowlisted note file (see test_relearn_apply.py for the relearn_apply
     unit-level version of that same guard).

Everything here talks through the real ASGI app (no mocks on the write path)
so the guards are proven at the route, not just in the core module.
