"""Every command string these screens print must actually run.

`tj status`'s trailer and `tj optimize`'s Next block are the escape hatch from
a capped view: the cap is only defensible because the full data is one named
command away. So a next-step string that does not parse is worse than the
uncapped screen it replaced, and it fails silently — the renderer happily
prints any string, and the defect only surfaces when a user types it.

That is exactly what shipped: both screens advertised `-v`, which was declared
on the top-level group and NOT on the subcommand, so `tj status -v` and
`tj optimize -v` exited 2 with "No such option '-v'" while `tj -v status`
worked. Reading `ctx.obj["verbose"]` is not the same as accepting the flag.

These tests parse the command strings out of the RENDERED output rather than
from a hand-kept list, so new copy is covered the moment it is printed, and
check each one against the real Click command tree: the subcommand must
resolve, and every option and positional value in it must be one the command
actually declares. A rename can therefore no longer turn a call to action
back into a lie.
